## The creation of the Walker Mech

Mechs are a recurring trope in Computer Games. Stefan Persson a.k.a Imphenzia's 10 Minute Challenge introduced a great tutorial on how to create one:

I also released a video on Youtube with the focus on creating a rather minimal model with a full and simple animation cycle:

The challenge now is to bring this model to the web.

## Step 2: export the model

To import the model in  A-Frame, it should be exported to glTF,
which is a modern format for 3D models.

With the loaded model in Blender, choose "File/Export/glTF2.0".

![start the export](/blog/walker/01.png)

Choose glTF (embedded) there. This will give us one file in the JSON Format. All three formats would work, but for a real production, the binary .glb would be preferable.

Usually you also want to apply all modifiers on export.

## Step 3: create an A-Frame HTML file

A-Frame is [a web framework for building virtual reality experiences](https://aframe.io/) maintained by Diego Marcos. You could also see it as a wrapper around the popular Three.JS library.

A-Frames "Hello, world" looks like this:

```html
<script>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>Hello, WebVR! • A-Frame</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hello, WebVR! • A-Frame">
      <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.4.2/aframe.min.js"><∕script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <a-scene background="color: #FAFAFA">
        <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9" shadow></a-box>
        <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E" shadow></a-sphere>
        <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D" shadow></a-cylinder>
        <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4" shadow></a-plane>
      </a-scene>
    </body>
  </html>
</script>
```

which results into a scene that can be navigated with WASD and is fully Web-VR ready:

![Image of the result of the Glitch.com example](/blog/walker/05.png)

So if you create an HTML file called index.html, drop the code in there, and open it in a web browser, you should see exactly this.

For the rest of this article we continue to use this skeleton, and add lines either to the header or the scene tag:

```html
<script>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>Hello, WebVR! • A-Frame</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hello, WebVR! • A-Frame">
      <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.4.2/aframe.min.js"><∕script>
      <!-- HEADER LINES GO HERE -->
    </head>
    <body>
      <a-scene>
        <!-- SCENE LINES GO HERE -->
      </a-scene>
    </ body>
  </html>
</script>
```

## Step 4: Use a web server

This worked because we didn't load external files yet.

To follow this, you need to either

- install a local webserver or
- use some hosting service like Glitch.

The reason for this is that we need to import a file which the browser considers a problem (CORS) if it it's loaded from the local file system.

This is explained in more detail on [this page](https://aframe.io/docs/) and there are many companies providing services like this,
for example [CodePen](https://codepen.io/mozillavr/pen/BjygdO), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/).

## Step 5: Import the model

Importing the model in A-Frame is just one line, which would place the Mech in the center so we'll move it back and rotate it a little.

Add this to the scene:

```html
<a-entity gltf-model="mech.gltf" position="0 0 -7" rotation="0 40 0"></a-entity>
```

The result should look like this:

![Just one line. Nice.](/blog/walker/06.png)

## Step 6: Make it move

Let's make the Mech move by having it walking a circle in A-Frame.

This means that we need to

- activate the glTF animation from Blender
- adding a circle movement in A-Frame

Using the animation from Blender is adding the `animation-mixer` component to the model entity. Since this is not part of the standard A-Frame distribution, we include the A-Frame Extras library written by Don McCurdy.

To add this component, we need to include it in the header section of the page:

```
<script type="preformatted">
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donmccurdy/aframe-extras@v6.1.1/dist/aframe-extras.js"></script>
  </script>
```

Having it walk in a circle requires the introduction of a second enitity that offsets the model and additionally adds the animation.

After some tweaking the code in the scene entity looks like that:

```html
<a-entity
  position="0 0 -12"
  animation="property: rotation.y; to: 0; from: 360; dur: 18000; loop: true; autoplay: true; easing: linear;"
>
  <a-entity position="8 0 0">
    <a-entity scale="0.5 0.5 0.5" gltf-model="mech.gltf" animation-mixer> </a-entity>
  </a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

So, are we done?

## Step 7: Add environment (optional)

By the book, we are done, but A-Frame makes it very easy to add some environment, so let's do this.

Diego F. Goberna wrote the A-Frame Environment component which makes this task adding two lines of code.
Again, add the library to the header:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/aframe-environment-component@1.3.0/dist/aframe-environment-component.min.js"></script>
</script>
```

Then, add the entity:

```
<a-entity environment="preset: desert;"></a-entity>
```

There's tons of parameters that can be tweaked, read about them in the [documentation](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-environment-component#parameters); here are some screen shots for `default`, `tron` and `yavapai` that include the shadows introduced in the last step.

## Step 8: add shadows (optional)

The Environment component adds lights already, but since the Mech walking circle spans quite some area, we need to introduce a light with a large shadowMap like this:

```html
<a-entity light="type: ambient; intensity:0.3;"></a-entity>
<a-entity
  id="sun"
  light="type: directional; intensity: 0.9;
  castShadow: true; shadowCameraFar: 500;
  shadowBias: -0.001;
  shadowMapHeight:2048; shadowMapWidth:2048;
  shadowCameraLeft: -50; shadowCameraRight: 50;
  shadowCameraBottom: -50; shadowCameraTop: 50;"
  position="3 10 10"
>
</a-entity>
```

Then we add shadows and prevent double lighting:

```html
<a-entity
  environment="preset: yavapai; shadow: true; lighting:none;"
></a-entity>
```
and add the shadow property to the gltf-model:

```html
<a-entity
  shadow="cast: true; receive: true"
  scale="0.5 0.5 0.5"
  gltf-model="mech.gltf"
  animation-mixer
>
</a-entity>
```
